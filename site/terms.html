                <h2>1. What You're Buying</h2>
                <p>
                    When you purchase from Xavigate, you're buying intellectual property—books, toolkits,
                    frameworks, and methodologies. You receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to
                    use these materials for your personal or organizational use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One purchase = one individual user or one organization. You own your copy of the materials,
                    but Xavigate retains copyright to the underlying content.
                </p>

                <h2>2. What You Can Do</h2>
                <p><strong>You may:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the materials to create your own courses, training programs, and educational content</li>
                    <li>Apply the frameworks and methodologies in your professional practice</li>
                    <li>Integrate the content with your existing tools, systems, and platforms</li>
                    <li>Adapt and customize the materials for your specific context</li>
                    <li>Create derivative works based on the frameworks (your courses, your books, your tools)</li>
                    <li>Use the materials with clients, students, or within your organization</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Your work is yours.</strong> Courses you create, books you write, tools you build using
                    these frameworks—that's your intellectual property. You retain full rights to your derivative works.
                </p>

                <h2>3. What You Can't Do</h2>
                <p><strong>You may not:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redistribute the original materials (books, toolkits, frameworks) to others</li>
                    <li>Resell or relicense Xavigate's materials to third parties</li>
                    <li>Share your login credentials or purchase access with others</li>
                    <li>Remove copyright notices, watermarks, or attribution from the materials</li>
                    <li>Claim authorship of Xavigate's original content</li>
                    <li>Use the materials beyond the scope of your individual or organizational license</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>One purchase = one license.</strong> If multiple people or organizations want access,
                    each needs their own license. Contact us for organizational licensing options.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Organizational Licensing</h2>
                <p>
                    Organizations may license materials for internal use, training programs, or course development.
                    Organizational licenses are priced separately and include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rights for multiple internal users within your organization</li>
                    <li>Permission to build training programs, courses, and internal content</li>
                    <li>Facilitation guides and implementation support materials</li>
                    <li>Rights to adapt content for your organizational context</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Organizational licensing terms are negotiated separately. Contact
                    <a href="mailto:support@xavigate.com">support@xavigate.com</a> for details.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Versions and Updates</h2>
                <p>
                    Your purchase includes the current version of the materials. If new versions are released
                    in the future, they are separate products. You may continue using your version indefinitely,
                    or purchase new versions if you choose. We do not promise free upgrades or discounted
                    pricing on future versions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minor corrections, typo fixes, and clarifications may be updated in your existing materials
                    at our discretion, but major revisions constitute new versions.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
                <p>
                    All Xavigate materials—including books, frameworks, methodologies, toolkits, assessments,
                    and related content—are protected by copyright and remain the intellectual property of
                    Xavigate LLC and Steven Rudolph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your purchase grants you a license to use the materials as described in these terms.
                    It does not transfer ownership of the underlying intellectual property.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Watermarking and Purchase Tracking</h2>
                <p>
                    Digital materials may be watermarked with your purchase information (name, email, purchase ID).
                    This helps us track unauthorized distribution while remaining unobtrusive for legitimate use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We maintain records of purchases to verify legitimate ownership and provide support to
                    authorized users.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Support and Access</h2>
                <p>
                    Support, updates, and resources are provided only to legitimate purchasers. If you need
                    assistance, contact us with your purchase information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to verify purchase authenticity before providing support or access
                    to additional resources.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Refunds</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature of digital intellectual property, all sales are final. We cannot offer
                    refunds once materials have been delivered and accessed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you experience technical issues with delivery or access, contact us within 7 days of
                    purchase and we'll resolve the issue.
                </p>

                <h2>10. No Warranties</h2>
                <p>
                    Materials are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied.
                    We do not guarantee specific results, outcomes, or business success from using these materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for how you apply the frameworks and methodologies in your own work.
                    We provide education and tools, not professional advice or guaranteed outcomes.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    Xavigate's liability is limited to the amount you paid for the materials. We are not
                    liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your
                    use of the materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This includes damages resulting from business losses, lost profits, or professional errors
                    in how you apply the methodologies.
                </p>

                <h2>12. Enforcement</h2>
                <p>
                    We take unauthorized distribution seriously. If we discover materials being shared,
                    redistributed, or resold in violation of these terms, we will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Revoke access to future updates and support</li>
                    <li>Pursue legal remedies including damages and attorney fees</li>
                    <li>Report violations to payment processors and distribution platforms</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We prefer to trust our customers. Most people are honest. But we will protect our
                    intellectual property when necessary.
                </p>

                <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update these terms as our products and business evolve. Changes apply to future
                    purchases. Your existing purchase remains governed by the terms in effect when you bought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll notify purchasers of material changes to terms that affect existing licenses.
                </p>

                <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>
                    These terms are governed by the laws of Texas, United States. Any disputes will be resolved
                    in Texas courts.
                </p>
